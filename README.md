# Space Portal
This was a hobby project I made to learn Flutter. This project is now discontinued and is not updated with latest stable version of Flutter.

### **Running this project will break everything**

If you want to try out the app you can install the latest apk from [releases](https://github.com/Oran/SpacePortal/releases/tag/final)

- Project includes CI/CD deployment with Github Actions that signs the app and deploys it to Google Play Store.
- Uses Riverpod for state management.
- Uses NASA Mars rover images API to get images from all rovers.
- SpaceX API to get upcoming launch details.
- Uses SpaceFlightNews API to get data on News and Articles
- Project also uses local caching with HiveDB
